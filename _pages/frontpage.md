Welcome to my page, this is where I showcase my art, research and some thoughts and processes about everything. I am a computer graphics researcher, currently a PhD studet at Texas A&M University working with  <a href="http://people.tamu.edu/~ergun/">Dr. Ergun Akleman</a> on weaving structures, ray tracing and volumetric decompositions. Does this have support for latex $\LaTeX$, lets to rendering equations here:
$$\begin{align*}w_o=\int_\Omega w_i\text{BRDF}(w_i,w_o)d\omega \end{align*}$$
